/**
 * User-declared blackout date ranges (design Q4, γ-fallback).
 *
 * Blackouts are a per-plan list of date ranges the user marks as off-limits
 * for study (vacations, exams, family events). They compose with the calendar
 * busy set as additional `BusyInterval` entries during scheduling.
 *
 * Shape persisted in `LearningPlan.manualBlackouts`:
 *   [{ from: "YYYY-MM-DD", to: "YYYY-MM-DD", reason?: "..." }]
 *
 * Inclusive on both ends. A single-day blackout uses `from === to`.
